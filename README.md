## Introduction
Autoencoders are a type of neural network used for unsupervised learning. They learn to reconstruct input data by encoding it into a lower-dimensional latent space and then decoding it back to the original input. This repository provides an example of using autoencoders for image generation, leveraging the power of neural networks to create new images.

## Installation
To get started, clone this repository and install the required dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/autoencoder-image-generation.git
cd autoencoder-image-generation
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To run the image generation example, follow these steps:

Prepare your dataset and place the images in the data directory.

Run the main.py script to train the autoencoder model and generate new images:
```bash
python main.py
```
Results
The results of the image generation task will be saved in the results directory. You can visualize the generated images and evaluate the performance of the model.
